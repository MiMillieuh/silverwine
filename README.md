# Silverwine

This repo contains silverwine, a wine version manager for Fedora silverblue and wine builds compiled from wine's git and sources with some light modifications to make it work a little better.

## How to use it ? 

Run the command bellow to install silverwine on your computer :

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiMillieuh/silverwine/main/silverwine | bash -s -- install latest`

## Limiations : 

MSI installer won't work for the most part.

Silverwine won't run all wine compatible software but it can already run a good chunck of it.

If you encounter an issue using Silverwine, Please before reporting it be certain that it's related to Silverwine and not to the software you're trying to run.
